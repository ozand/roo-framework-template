## Overview
This directory contains configuration and rule files for the Roo framework implementation.

## Components
- `system_info.md`: Contains system configuration and environment details
- `tool_definitions.md`: Defines available tools and their specifications

## Rules
The framework implements the following operational rules:
- [R16_SafetyProtocols.md](rules/R16_SafetyProtocols.md): Safety and verification protocols
- [R18_GitWorkflowSOP.md](rules/R18_GitWorkflowSOP.md): Standard Git workflow procedures
- [R19_PrincipleOfMinimalAction.md](rules/R19_PrincipleOfMinimalAction.md): Guidelines for minimal necessary actions

## Usage
1. All components and rules must be maintained according to their specifications
2. New rules should follow the same numbering and documentation format
3. Components should be kept platform-agnostic where possible
