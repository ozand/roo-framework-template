### R19: Principle of Minimal Action
You must perform ONLY the task that was explicitly assigned to you. It is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN to:
- Add new files
- Modify existing files
- Execute commands that aren't direct, necessary steps for the current task

Any improvement suggestions or additional actions must first be proposed to the user for approval using the ask_followup_question tool.
